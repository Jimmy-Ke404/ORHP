# Optimal Ride Hailing Pricing for Less Congested Roads
## Introduction
This repository implements algorithms, fleet travel behaviors, and a pricing scheme in our paper [Leveraging ride-hailing services for social good: Fleet optimal routing and system optimal pricing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X23002735) published on a top-tier transportation research journal [Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/transportation-research-part-c-emerging-technologies). Experiments are conducted on two networks, including the Sioux Falls network and the Pittsburgh network.

This repository provides reusable code for practioners and students interested in network equilibria. Aside solving cutting-edge network equilibrium formulations in the paper, this repository implements solving classical network equilibria including the user equilibrium (UE) and the system optimum (SO).  

Moreover, this repository provides source code and data for researchers with research interests of ride-hailing, optimal pricing, vehicle routing, and network equilibrium. 

Firstly, we consider a mixed equilibrium of ride-hailing vehicles and driving vehicles. The driving vehicles follow the UE routing principle, while the ride-hailing vehicles may follow the UE, the SO, the fleet optimal (FO), or the proposed fleet optimal with service constraints (FOSC) routing principle. Note the proposed FOSC fleet routing principle is able to reduce the fleet travel time of ride-hailing vehicles by routing vehicles cooperatively while maintain the fairness among ride-hailing passengers. The following figures plot results of FOSC on the Sioux Falls network.

  <figcaption>Figure: Unfairness among ride-hailing passengers on the Sioux Falls network. Loaded unfairness is the ratio of actual experienced travel time to the travel time of the fastest route for the same origin-destination pair. The figure shows the FOSC leads much less unfairness among ride-hailing passengers. In addition, FOSC provides the ride-hailing passengers who detour with monetary or credit compensations.</figcaption>

On top of the mixed equilibrium of driving vehicles and ride-hailing vehicles, we proposed an optimal ride-hailing pricing scheme (ORHP) with subsidy from public agencies to intervene with ride-hailing companies (e.g., Uber and Lyft) aiming at mitigating congestion of the whole network (reducing total travel time of all vehicles), while considering ride-hailing serviceâ€™s quality and profitability. Our experiments indicate ORHP is able to reduce total travel time by 16,813 hours with a subsidy cost of $38,701 on the Sioux Falls network. The following figure shows how ORHP makes the Sioux Falls network less congested.

  <figcaption>Figure: V/C ratios and subsidies for all links in the Sioux Falls network, when minimizing the total travel time. (a): V/C ratios measure congestion levels on links, and higher is more congested. (b): ORHP tends to assign subsidies to under-congested links near to over-congested links, so that vehicles are induced from over-congested links to under-congested links. Therefore, the total travel time is reduced by balancing link congestion. (c) and (d): By comparing two plots, we can find ORHP pushes the network towards the optimal state (i.e., ME-SO), and over-congested links are less congested under ORHP.  </figcaption>

## Requirements
This repo should be run on `Python==3.8.8` with following packages.
- `numpy==1.20.1`
- `matplotlib==3.3.4`
- `sympy==1.8`
- `networkx==2.5`
- `geopandas==0.10.2`
- `scipy==1.6.2`

## Basic WorkFlow
To implement this repo, you need to clone the repo to your machine, and then install packages as required in the `Requirements` section.

This repo supports solving network equilibria, solving optimal pricing with equilibrium constraints, and results visualization on the Sioux Falls network and the Pittsburgh network.

### Solve network equilibria
Currently, network equilibria supported by the repo include the user equilibrium (UE), the system optimum (SO), and various mixed equilibrium (ME). You can use the following command in your terminal.

```python example_run_ME.py {network} {equilibrium_type}```

where argument `network` should be one in `['SiouxFalls', 'PGH']`, and argument `equilibrium_type` should be one in the following

- `'ME-FO'`: Mixed equibrium of driving vehicles following UE and ride-hailing vehicles following FO.
- `'ME-SO'`: Mixed equibrium of driving vehicles following UE and ride-hailing vehicles following SO.
- `'ME-FOSC'`: Mixed equibrium of driving vehicles following UE and ride-hailing vehicles following FOSC.
- `'Baseline-SO'`: A baseline where all vehicles follow SO.
- `'Baseline-UE'`: A baseline where all vehicles follow UE.

### Solve optimal pricing problems with equilibrium constraints
The repo is able to solve ORHP on top of ME-FOSC by using command line.

```python example_run_ORHP.py {network}```

where argument `network` should be one in `['SiouxFalls', 'PGH']`. Note this will run ORHP with different gammas that measure a trade-off between total travel time reduction and subsidy cost, and smaller gamma means larger total travel time reduction.

### Results visualization
You can use this repo to plot results of network equilibria and optimal pricing after running corresponding experiments. Specifically, `Result_visualization_SiouxFalls_network.ipynb` includes code for plotting results of the Sioux Falls network, and `Result_visualization_Pittsburgh_network.ipynb` is for the Pittsburgh network.
